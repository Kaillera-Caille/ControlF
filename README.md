# ControlF
Subdomain finder made from scratch in C++

## About
Welcome to my Subdomain finder
I made it from scratch to work on windows since most of the recon tools are linux only, i still have somethings to tweak but feel free to use the source code or the app itself.

### Things i still want to do on it:

[ ] Make the program still onn when you type something wrong or leave all blank.

[] Output the results on a .txt file.

[ ] Add a default wordlist folder.

[ ] Enable folder navigation.

## Installing

All links are avaiable in [Releases](https://github.com/Kaillera-Caille/ControlF/releases) tab.

## Usage: 

1 - Insert target domain: 

    example.com

2 - Insert wordlist path: 

    c:/wordlist/wordlist.txt
  > in this version you will have to be specific with paths, but i'll change that asap.
